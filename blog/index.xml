      <description>It’s been a bit of a ride since my last update (8 months past) but I’m so happy to say that I’ve enjoyed most of it and I’m in a much better place than I was. I’ve also feel that I should be writing more often not only for those that are genuinely interested in my well being or friendship, but for myself. I try not to regret things in my life, so in turn I am proud of my mundane yet fulfilling day to day activities.</description>

      <description>Where to start? Isn’t this the way when you’ve had a long absence from writing about yourself? I genuinely feel a little lost trying to convey my thoughts onto “paper” when you’ve not made a regular effort to do so. It’s like having a catch up with a friend you haven’t seen since forever and is bursting to tell them everything – little pockets of information and experiences that don’t quite flow into one another… I tend to find starting from the most recent is easiest, perhaps I’ll work my way backwards eventually if my friend is still willing to listen to me!</description>

      <description>Throughout our educational journey we have always been taught that generally two heads are better than one. That teams working at their optimum could do the impossible and it was almost the impossible to achieve this equilibrium. We could go on for days talking about all the factors on how to improve the efficiency of a development team, utilising and identifying the skills of the engineers and their motivations or even how to make great project plans….</description>
