      <description>It’s been a bit of a ride since my last update (8 months past) but I’m so happy to say that I’ve enjoyed most of it and I’m in a much better place than I was. I’ve also feel that I should be writing more often not only for those that are genuinely interested in my well being or friendship, but for myself. I try not to regret things in my life, so in turn I am proud of my mundane yet fulfilling day to day activities.</description>

      <title>Struggling with postnatal mental health and a fresh start with Montessori</title>

      <description>Where to start? Isn’t this the way when you’ve had a long absence from writing about yourself? I genuinely feel a little lost trying to convey my thoughts onto “paper” when you’ve not made a regular effort to do so. It’s like having a catch up with a friend you haven’t seen since forever and is bursting to tell them everything – little pockets of information and experiences that don’t quite flow into one another… I tend to find starting from the most recent is easiest, perhaps I’ll work my way backwards eventually if my friend is still willing to listen to me!</description>
