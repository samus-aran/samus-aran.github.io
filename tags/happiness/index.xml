      <description>It’s been a bit of a ride since my last update (8 months past) but I’m so happy to say that I’ve enjoyed most of it and I’m in a much better place than I was. I’ve also feel that I should be writing more often not only for those that are genuinely interested in my well being or friendship, but for myself. I try not to regret things in my life, so in turn I am proud of my mundane yet fulfilling day to day activities.</description>
