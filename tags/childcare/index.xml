      <description>Where to start? Isn’t this the way when you’ve had a long absence from writing about yourself? I genuinely feel a little lost trying to convey my thoughts onto “paper” when you’ve not made a regular effort to do so. It’s like having a catch up with a friend you haven’t seen since forever and is bursting to tell them everything – little pockets of information and experiences that don’t quite flow into one another… I tend to find starting from the most recent is easiest, perhaps I’ll work my way backwards eventually if my friend is still willing to listen to me!</description>
