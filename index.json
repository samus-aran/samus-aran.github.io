    "body": "It’s been a bit of a ride since my last update (8 months past) but I’m so happy to say that I’ve enjoyed most of it and I’m in a much better place than I was. I’ve also feel that I should be writing more often not only for those that are genuinely interested in my well being or friendship, but for myself. I try not to regret things in my life, so in turn I am proud of my mundane yet fulfilling day to day activities. Maybe on occasion I will take up a particular topic related to community management, open source, tech industry etc, but I don’t feel I need to hold back if I want to share more of my life because very much of it life seeps into how I work, the decisions I make, the priorities I have. Most of all my work related achievements came from time spent (which is often) reflecting on my life: what makes me happy and what I think is right.\nSo yeah, this is a quick catch up and only the iceberg of thoughts I had since being diagnosed with postnatal depression back in January.\nFirst off, I’m feeling a lot better. In fact I’m actually now off the setraline medication. I’m still adapting to my feelings post meds and changing things in my life to ensure that I don’t relapse, but I’m generally feeling more centered and have a much clearer understanding of what sincerely makes and keeps me happy. During the past year, whilst on the remaining of my maternity leave, I had the realisation that I had always felt I needed be productive, even during my down time. As well as this I found I was often justifying the limitation of time dedicated to my desires/passions because it wasn’t contributing to others. As if my position in the world was solely to be of ‘use’ to others and their cause. Being that “2nd in command” I always thought was commendable. Whether that was because I watched a lot of cartoons or messages throughout my life that implied that, who knows. But for the longest time I always saw any extra time I had should be doing something “productive” and if it wasn’t then I was being lazy. I know that sounds very definitive but yes, I did. I have achieved a lot throughout my younger years with utilising a lot of that critical mindset: a successful Highland dancer winning at frequent competitions; playing cello at national orchestras; working through my career fairly quickly. Don’t get me wrong, I am proud of what I did but those achievements always came with guilt – I could’ve been more or sooner if I just hadn’t lazed about.\nSometimes I wonder what could’ve happened if I was more kinder and dedicated to myself. But I don’t want to. I’m happy where I am now and focusing on the past too much would distract me from creating a better future. I feel, at this moment in time, I have learned what I’ve needed from looking backwards to now look onward.\nSo anyway, yeah, tip of the icebergs as I said. Maybe I’ll go into it more in another post (that really should be this blog’s catchphrase).\nI’m back at work at SalesAgility and I’m loving it! Although I prefer working from home, I do enjoy going into the office weekly to see everyone and plus Stirling is such a lovely place to walk around in. I’ve started a number of interests just to name a few: sewing; foraging; knitting; and diy. I will 100% go into those topics within this blog, most likely dedicated categories!\nAlthough I am happier in myself, I’m still reluctant to take too much on. I am aware of all the amazing projects I was involved with earlier in the year and I do want to step back into them but I am not promising anything still. Only now I’m able to set up better boundaries of my work and life as well as my professional hobbies and non professional hobbies time shared. If the projects would have me back I’ll be fully committed, but until I can give them my genuine focus I will genuinely be screaming for them from the side lines.\nHere’s a photo update of the office. I love this space it’s just so me. I’ll admit 50% of it’s contents are my hubby’s interest but you can tell they overlap a fair bit. I need to do something about those boxes next to the monitors.. but I’m getting there: I’m tackling each room marie kondo (which she doesn’t recommend I should be doing) style and it’s helps immensely.\n",

    "body": "Where to start? Isn’t this the way when you’ve had a long absence from writing about yourself? I genuinely feel a little lost trying to convey my thoughts onto “paper” when you’ve not made a regular effort to do so. It’s like having a catch up with a friend you haven’t seen since forever and is bursting to tell them everything – little pockets of information and experiences that don’t quite flow into one another… I tend to find starting from the most recent is easiest, perhaps I’ll work my way backwards eventually if my friend is still willing to listen to me!\nIt’s February 2021 already, four months into my maternity leave, and I feel most of my re-evaluation of motherhood (since this is my second child) has happened in the past month. Only now since giving birth in October am I starting to feel more aware of my thoughts that I can actually begin to unravel and make sense of them. Prior to December I was functioning as a human but in hindsight I was accumulating stressful and negative thoughts which got worse and worse with the complete Scottish lockdown from the Christmas period onwards. All schools and nurseries were closed, including children activities. This meant that my three year old daughter was home with me and my three months baby without a means of escape. Days just melted into each other and although we (my husband and I) rotated the baby night watch and got relatively good sleep I was feeling more and more isolated even whilst my husband was home with the kids.\nI became increasingly less patient with my daughter. This then developed into losing my temper often and dramatically and ultimately flat out refusing to play with her. All I wanted was to not be called upon, not to be touched, not to be acknowledged. I don’t feel these words quite fully express my state of mind during those times but its just an indication that I was in a mental hole. I eventually reached out for help, more accurately my husband insisted I do so. The support I had was wonderful, my health visitor and GP both hearing my situation and praising me for being so honest. I was diagnosed with postnatal/postpartum depression. That was a couple of weeks back and with the medication given and steps taken to relieve some of my burden I do feel more calm and able to handle a 3 year old’s mood swings better. I would like to perhaps explore that experience in a separate post but for now I just want to focus on getting better. I may look at it retrospectively when I feel that it won’t be able to pull me back in.\nOne of the steps that helped me feel more “together” was providing April abit more education and structure to her days. Due to the absence of her regular children activities and nursery our days just felt like “meh” being stuck in the house and since having a 3 month baby there was little time to plan for the next day. We would try to go out often but being unable to breastfeed in a Scottish park in the middle of Winter limited our time and distance. Seriously, I’ve tried it twice and I was quite literally freezing my tits off. If I could at least fill her days with discovery and expose her to new concepts within the confinements of lockdown then I would feel I had achieved something – living rather than just surviving, So I made the decision that I was going to take this seriously for the sake of my daughter’s and my own mental health. One of the reasons I went in a particular direction was for the fact that I really want to home school April. It’s a path I was eager to explore before perhaps fully committing to it later when April is at school age.\nI first reached out to some tech communities and they were extremely helpful with enlightening me on the aspects of homeschooling, unschooling and more. One teaching approach that I felt inspired by and could more easily implement in our situation was Montessori. Montessori in a nutshell is the approach to teaching children independence through every day practical life activities with relatively little interference from the educator (or parent). Children express their interest in an area which then the educator would encourage them to further expand upon. So if they are interested in arctic animal then we would provide them the means and opportunities to learn more about that particular topic. Now I’m not going to go through all the ins and outs of Montessori as I could explain that in a separate post as well as how I interpreted it. Let’s just say there are some aspects I like and thus implemented but there are some that I just completely disagree with. I continue to read a lot of blogs and articles and picked up the book “The Montessori Toddler”.\nSo it began: the preparation of the house. First off, the shelves. My husband flat out refused to purchase any so with my resourcefulness (and boredom perhaps) I “built” two shelving units out of the mountain of cardboard we still had from Christmas and our endless deliveries. The concept was to present toys (which are in rotation) so the child would be attracted to and thus engage with.\nSecond task and this was one of the biggest problems I had to tackle in April’s current environment. She just has too much damn crap! Clutter, clutter, clutter everywhere! In a heartbeat I would donate most of the toys and only keep the selective few that were very often played with but of course all the charity shops are closed… so at the moment they are all hidden away in our units relatively out of sight. Out of the heap I selected ones that I felt gave her some stimulus rather than just entertaining her. Some were new activities: threading beads, geoboard with elastic bands, wooden puzzles, sand tray and a lockbox.\nThirdly I needed to inject more reading opportunities. Previously we only read to April at night time and as someone who feels words are extremely difficult I didn’t want April to experience my shame or embarrassment. So I set off again with a gluegun in hand and built a book box which sits in our living room. This past week we have increased our reading time to about 30 minutes in the morning which I’m pretty happy with. Woot woot.\nLastly on the whirlwind of re-vamping April’s day I bought a few things to help April be more independent and made them easily accessible within her reach. These include; a child size brush, hand brush and shovel hanging up in the hallway; a cup and glass jug on her table that I fill with juice throughout the day along with a face size towel for when she spills anything. Another aspect I have done was the deconstruction of tasks that I had usually taken for granted. Now I either allow her to take over or simply participate in. One task being is that in the morning I provide her with a bowl, a small jug of milk and one of those kidsize kellogs cereal boxes. She can now open the box, rip the plastic bag and pour everything herself. The simple task of learning how to open crisps and plastic packaging she has accomplished within the week amazes me – I used to do this for her!\nHowever it hasn’t all been a success. The toys and activities set out on the shelves, known as shelf work, was met with little interest. A part of the Montessori method is the observation of the child. This allows the educator/parent to assess their interests and whether activities are too easy or too hard. I keep a little notebook close by so I can jot down what peaks her interest and sometimes the duration of her attention to tasks/activities. I found that the tasks provided had varied results – some too hard, some too easy and some just not interested in. Often the activities she just wasn’t interested in turned into another form of play… mostly pretend play. At first I was pretty disappointed, I had hoped that this would’ve had more success and substantially help my depression. But I had to be realistic. Sure enough it wasn’t a roaring success to fully occupy my daughter’s day but I think I have gain something invaluable… An awareness of April’s interests and her mastered skills.\nThrough all my observations I’m able to identify at least five areas of interests, what forms of play she enjoys most and her temperament when she fails (and achieves) tasks. Of course I need to consider that this being the first week of such “structured” play that she may need to adjust to it herself but I’m sure (praying) that she’ll learn more concentration as time goes on.\nSo all in all this is a journey that I’ve recently thrown myself into with most of the little time available looking up activities and making props to not only educate but entertain April. I may be naive to think that this time dedicated will decrease once I have a larger knowledge base of resources. I am hoping it does. But I also accept that it is something to keep fairly close to my attention. This does mean, from my perspective, that my other projects have suffered. I begrudgingly accept that. However, I choose to focus on April’s (as well as Ridley’s) play as I believe that one of the fundamental causes to my current depression was that I had ultimately convinced myself I was an inadequate mother. I acknowledge that this isn’t anything out of the ordinary and I’m sure other parents have felt this too during lockdown. Life isn’t a competition and we all have unique situations. So saying this I’m making a point not to compare myself nor would I desire anyone doing so with me – we all handle lockdown differently, better or worse than others. I’m just happy that I got the support from my family and health workers that I feel is working and I’m able to occupy my time with tasks that feel both satisfying and purposeful.\nDamn, this post turned out much longer than expected. Despite boring the hell out of you the reader this has been extremely therapeutic for me. Feels good writing this out. Reminds me of my addiction to Live Journal. Perhaps I’ll commit to more posts in the future, but first I must get back to my hot gluing and Pinterest boards full of “Rainy Day” kids activities.\n",

    "date": "",

    "body": "Throughout our educational journey we have always been taught that generally two heads are better than one. That teams working at their optimum could do the impossible and it was almost the impossible to achieve this equilibrium. We could go on for days talking about all the factors on how to improve the efficiency of a development team, utilising and identifying the skills of the engineers and their motivations or even how to make great project plans…. However from my experience, and a lot of others’ research, what it really all comes down to is a pretty obvious (or not) factor\u0026hellip;\nPeople.\nWell d’uh I hear you say. Of course it’s the people: good people make good software, right?\nArguably no, they maybe good workers, great even, but may not be with each other. So what we should be saying is great teams make great software. The word team boils down to: a unit of great people that work great together.\nBut ask yourself, when, as students or as junior engineers, did we have this realisation or have we even had it yet? I didn’t fully appreciate the value of my team-player skills until well after acquiring a number of software developer roles and now leading the product team and being the community manager of an open source CRM, SuiteCRM. Prior to this immersion of open source I had relatively little opportunity to flex my emotional intelligence muscles and found myself making a lot of rookie mistakes on how to talk to others and how to both direct and connect with these relative distant strangers, though like minded and talented people, towards the same goal of improving the product. Although this scenario refers to an open source community it can easily be applied to any technical team working towards team perfection.\nSoft skills, or otherwise known as either professional or people skills, are not often talked about in the tech scene as being an necessity. More often it’s assumed that these skills will be learned at one point in peoples’ careers, or teams simply accept they aren’t worth refining versus the more covenanted skill of being technically knowledgable. But in open source, being able to communicate and converse with others is a core principle and without good soft skills then the project or software will more often fail due to lack of collective direction or leadership. We tend to think that we can solve a lot of our problems by throwing more tools or using the latest technology but often the hardest part is getting people to work together, collaborating and sharing mutual respect. This is something that should be considered placed at a higher importance than the tools \u0026amp; languages themselves when teaching the next generation of engineers. Technology moves so fast that often what language or framework we teach our students usually becomes obsolete in a couple of years. So we should be arming our students with good social skills that they will evidently need in order to adapt with the often changing technology landscape.\nThat’s where open source communities can help by being a great learning platform for aiding students to not only hone these soft skills but also teach them of the principles of Open Source: transparency; collaboration; and participation. They will learn early on in their studies how their interactions within an online community and the values of open source can have a knock on affect on their daily lives not only making better software but better themselves as people which then has a positive impact on society.\nOk, You may question if have my head in clouds in regards whether merely participating in open source as a student could shape the world, but does that sound so crazy? Let’s explore that..\nSo what are soft skills and how can open source help develop them? As I stated earlier, soft skills in the tech industry are highly sought after and to add to this so are the environments in which young engineers can actually learn them from a wide number of peers. A large chunk of a student’s curriculum is of concentrated technical content mostly completed in isolation. Yes, there are team projects, but how often did you find yourself tripping up on miscommunication and/or direction with minimum guidance or incentive to correct? You could carry the team for a little while, but we all know that this isn’t sustainable in corporate teams and burn out is often around the corner. Course material that is dedicated to the participation of open source can help students build better social skills by immersing the student in friendly and collaborative online communities whilst sharpening the student’s technical proficiency.\nI’ve listed below a few categorisations of soft skills, what attributes they include and then examples of scenarios within open source that students would have a chance to practise those skills.\n   SKILL INCLUDE OSS SCENARIOS     Communication (written \u0026amp; oral) descriptive; tone of voice; confidence; responsive write \u0026amp; comment code, update issue \u0026amp; other docs, ask for clarification   Teamwork pragmatic; goal driven; task completion; conflicts monitor progress \u0026amp; help each other e.g. contributing to other team members work to achieve a bug/feature   Interpersonal empathy; patience; tolerance; listening identifying with community members, peers \u0026amp; the code e.g. learn of other people situations, or roles within the community/work   Reflection review; constructive criticism; open mindedness post-mortem, improve code based on feedback, adapting solutions e.g. code review of a PR or a RFC   Critical Thinking analysis; rational; evaluation; test, trace, \u0026amp; debug code e.g. Working through debug logs, or deciphering patterns   Management delegation; leadership; prioritisation plan work \u0026amp; assign (or nominate) tasks to other team members   Problem Solving clarification; attention to detail; innovation; decision making design fix or feature (UI, code, tests, docs)    Of course learning these attributes can be experienced outside of open source, but with the sheer number of open source projects available to choose from there’s bound to be something of interest to each student and at any skill level. This lower barrier of entry can attract earlier education to utilise open source as a means to explore community mentality even if they don’t possess advanced technical knowledge.\nStudents would have the chance to experience the industry with using real world scenarios and drives. Whether these drives are lead by the project’s roadmap, or by other community members, students would see their contribution being part of something bigger and having that tangible result helps stimulates their learning. It would also allow students to engage and learn from others who have a current knowledge of being in the industry, best practises and pro tips.\nAs well as practising acceptable and productive conversing between other community members, students will also see from different perceptions (maintainers, users, developers) and backgrounds thus helping them to learn and experience empathy not only for the people but the code itself.\nHowever, not all communities are sunshine and rainbows, so open source projects need to play their part as well to provide safe and inclusive communities.\nShaping the world, together.. So, how does this help our industry, better yet our society? Well, by introducing the concept of both the principles of open source and participation at the grass roots we can encourage team mentality early on even before they enter the workforce. There have been positive findings* showing that by merely participating in a open source project as part of an exercise students were more favourable to further take computing studies even when they hadn’t considered it. By introducing this open source participation to students at early stages of their education (perhaps before their GSCE/N5s) this would provide them previously unconsidered opportunities: opportunities for young girls, minority groups and those with disabilities. Thus when students have graduated (or even before) they can inject into the industry diversity and thus leading to more innovation on better ways of working and solutions.\nAlso, if the students had positive experiences during their studies then by the time they join the work force they will already have developed this mindset of seeking the alternatives to proprietary as well as challenging the negative perception of open source.\nAs we examined earlier, that being in an open source community, be it active and healthy, would help invoke the community mentality in students and that working together you can achieve great things than when working alone. Students would learn of compromise, friendships and overcome conflicts for the sake of the community\u0026rsquo;s greater goal. Good FOSS communities usually have a code of conduct to adhere to which usually includes points about bullying and harassing and that it would not be tolerated. This is enforced and supported by community members who usually provide quick feedback to those that are not following the expected positive and ethical behaviour presenting the students with consequences of their actions. This can help a student observe, learn and ideally emulate in other aspects of their lives leading to a better understanding and appreciation of other members of society.\nWow, all that from participating in open source? Oh there is so many benefits of how students can learn from open source, that’s only the tip of the iceberg! However, what I hope you will take away from this is that by introducing open source participation at earlier stages of education we can teach our children how to socially conduct themselves in online communities thus helping them grow into positive and community oriented adults, not only to lead our tech industry but also shape humanity for the better.\n* Evaluating Student Experiences in Developing Software for Humanity, Gregory W.

    "body": "Who am I? My name is Ashley Nicolson. I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about open source and people. I\u0026rsquo;m a programmer (primarily in PHP), mentor and on occassion, speaker. I live in bonnie Scotland (weggie) with my husband, 3 year old daughter + baby due 2020 and two fur babies (kitties). I work for SalesAgility, the maintainers of SuiteCRM, at the head quarters Stirling, Scotland (though currently remotely).\nThis blog, its contents and opinions are my own. I blog about open source, education, scotland, community building, management, exciting places and experiences. I also have a podcast, Scotland Open Source, that I interview Scottish open source developers, advocates and companies to help promote themselves, their projects and generally discuss the importance and impact of open source in the Scottish tech industry.\nI love video games, meeting new people, supporting others to achieve amazing things, and try to apply \u0026ldquo;openness\u0026rdquo; to a number of aspects in my life.\n \u0026ldquo;Open source represents the concept that, purely through the distribution of code and software, humanity is demonstrable by the passion and dedication of people making the world a better place.\u0026rdquo;\n What do I do? I\u0026rsquo;m Head of Communty @ SalesAgility. My day to day is bridging the gap between the community, our internal teams and the project itself. This includes setting up community teams, encouraging participation, organising community content creation, events and all the interpersonal aspects inbetween.\nI started off as a software engineer, then inched my way into team leader to then be promoted to Head of Product (\u0026amp; Community). I have now since dedicated my time fully to being the voice of the Community and their champion for the SuiteCRM roadmap. During my time I\u0026rsquo;ve played a pivotal role in growing and developing the company’s open source community, with SuiteCRM contributions from the community growing by more than 750% between 2015 and 2019. Currently, our community forum is made up of about 49,000 active members including partners.\nI am also the co-founder of the Scotland Open Source Users Meetups (SOSUM), which have over 100 members. SOSUM meetups bring people together around Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), with a focus on discovering projects, discussing the impact of FOSS on the industry, and exploring ways to promote a healthy open source ecosystem. SOSUM meetups are open to all skill levels and are a combination of talks, workshops and demonstrations about all aspects of open source. There are also announcements on the world of open source, debates on open source ethics, and discussions of how to support and manage online communities and projects.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also part of the Ladies of Code community in Glasgow, which is a network made up of over 750 women, all eager to learn digital skills.\nTo help promote open source I partner with schools across Scotland delivering educational activities on open source. I\u0026rsquo;ve taught over 100 primary school children on open source participation and technologies in 2020 (before COVID-19 struck). Looking forward to picking that back up again when schools return.\nWhere am I going? I would love 💖 to get open source into the computer science curriculum in Scotland. With this, I want to increase girls’ computer science enrollment, instill a positive experience with open source, and increase awareness of the importance of open source in education. I\u0026rsquo;m working with a number of teachers in Scotland on how to create suitable course material to encourage open source participation and learning outcomes.\nI am also looking to mature and develop SOSUM meetups so that they become a voice for the open source community in Scotland. This will include regular corporate sponsorship to assist with hosting, and to facilitate thought provoking discussion around open source life, work, and its impact on industry and society. I\u0026rsquo;m currently raising awareness of open source through the Scotland Open Source podcast but feel there is more to do. Whether this be to organize more workshops, conferences, and events around open source. Do get in touch if you wish to sponsor, attend, or expand upon these ideas! I\u0026rsquo;m all ears 👂\n",
